# Covi-Vaccination

Covi-Vaccination is an online vaccination booking platform for Indian citizens
to use with ease. To overcome this situation of global pandemic, everyone
must be vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus. If the user does not have an
account, they can register. From this form, the data will be stored in the user
database in CoreData. The user can login to the app using their login
credentials, which will be then verified with the data in the database, and if
the login information matches, the user will be successfully logged in. The
Dashboard will show the current date data of individuals who have registered,
the total number of vaccine doses, and the sites/centres that are conducting
vaccination. Hereafter, the user can book their slot by either clicking on Get
Vaccinated button or choose from the tab controller. The app will by default,
take the current location of the user and show the available centres nearby.
Users can select the hospital as per their convenience and further fill in the
general details; choose the Vaccine, Date, and time. All the appointment
details will be stored in Myappointments CoreData. The user has the facility
to update the name if they have entered the wrong data by mistake, or the
user can cancel the appointment. The profile will show the details of the user
that has logged in.
